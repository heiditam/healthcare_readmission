  <div class="content">
    <p>Welcome to Heidi Tam's website dedicated to analyzing <strong>hospital readmission rates</strong>. This project explores patterns in patient encounters, identify high-risk cases, and uncover actionable insights to help healthcare providers reduce preventable readmissions.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        👉🏻 <strong>Overview: </strong>This project aims to estimate hospital readmissions in order to reduce healthcare insurance costs and improve patient outcomes. The dataset used was the <i>Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008</i> dataset, found in the UC Irvine Machine Learing Repository. The dataset includes the hospital records of patients from 130 American hospitals who were diagnosed with diabetes and stayed for up to fourteen days.
        The dataset analyzed includes patient identifiers, demographic details, and admission characteristics, such as admission type, discharge disposition, and source of admission.
        Clinical details, such as length of hospital stay, number of lab procedures, medications administered, and diagnostic codes provide insight into the status of patient health and the level of patient care received.
        Finally, the dataset utilized covers diabetes-specific indicators, including blood glucose tests, medication usage, and changes in medication and overall diabetes management to assess risk of readmission with the true outcome.<br>
        👉🏻 <strong>Purpose:</strong> to identify the key predictors and patterns, aiming to accurately forecast whether patient will be readmitted within thirty days of discharge. The overarching goal is to improve 
        patient care outcomes and to minimize preventable returns to the hospital.

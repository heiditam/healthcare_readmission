    <p>👋🏻 Welcome to Heidi Tam's website dedicated to analyzing <strong>hospital readmission rates</strong>. This project explores patterns in patient encounters, identify high-risk cases, and uncover actionable insights to help healthcare providers reduce preventable readmissions.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      👉🏻 <strong>Essential Question:</strong> Who do we follow up with after discharge to avoid readmission? <br>
        👉🏻 <strong>Overview: </strong>This project aims to estimate hospital readmissions in order to reduce healthcare insurance costs and improve patient outcomes. The dataset used was the <i>Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008</i> dataset, found in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes the hospital records of patients from 130 American hospitals who were diagnosed with diabetes and stayed for up to fourteen days.
        The dataset analyzed includes patient identifiers, demographic details, and admission characteristics, such as admission type, discharge disposition, and source of admission.
        Clinical details, such as length of hospital stay, number of lab procedures, medications administered, and diagnostic codes provide insight into the status of patient health and the level of patient care received.
        Finally, the dataset utilized covers diabetes-specific indicators, including blood glucose tests, medication usage, and changes in medication and overall diabetes management to assess risk of readmission with the true outcome.<br>
        👉🏻 <strong>Purpose:</strong> to identify the key predictors and patterns, aiming to accurately forecast whether patient will be readmitted within thirty days of discharge. The overarching goal is to improve 
        patient care outcomes and to minimize preventable returns to the hospital. <br>

        <h2>Groups At Risk</h2>
        <iframe src = 'HTMLs/age_readmission.html' width="600" height="500"></iframe>
        <p>After conducting a <strong>Chi-Squared Test for Independence</strong>, we retrieved a chi-squared statistic of about 116.609 and a <strong>p-value of about 6.6 * 10^(-21)</strong>
        Since the p-value is less than the threshold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between readmission rate and age.
       In other words, there is <strong>statistically significant evidence of an association</strong> between age and readmission.
       From the graph, 70-80-year-olds have the highest likelihood of readmission (3,069 patients readmitted) compared to 0-10-year-olds, which had the least number of readmitted patients, 3 out of 101,766 patients.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Treatment Impact</h2>
        Using a Chi-Squared contingency table, some of the medications significantly linked with higher readmission were insulin, metformin, and repaglinide. <br> <br>
        <img src="PNGs/insulin_odds_ratios.png" alt="Insulin Odds Ratio" width="600" height="400"> 
        <br><br>
        From a <strong>Logit Regression Analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Patients with <strong>steady insulin</strong> have <strong>12% higher odds</strong> of readmission than those not on insulin.</li>
          <li>Patients with <strong>increasing insulin</strong> dosage have <strong>34% higher odds</strong> of readmission.</li>
          <li>Patients with <strong>decreasing insulin</strong> have <strong>45% higher odds</strong> of readmission.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Clinical Insight</h2>
        <iframe src="HTMLs/max_glu_fig.html" width="600" height="500"></iframe>
        <p>A <strong>Chi Square Test of Independence</strong> between maximum glucose serum levels and readmitted rates yielded a chi-squared value of about 6.89 and a <strong>p-value of 0.03.</strong>
        Since the p-value is less than the threshold of 0.05, there is a significant difference of readmission rates between each glucose serum level (normal, > 200, and > 300).
       In this visualization, the yellow dotted line represents the proportion of encounters with a normal glucose serum level that resulted in readmittance: about 11.36%.
       From the graph, the readmittance rate for > 200 was slightly higher, reaching 12.46%. The <strong>readmittance rate for > 300 was notably higher</strong> than the yellow line, reaching 14.32% readmitted.
       In other words, the more glucose serum a patient's blood contained was associated with <strong>a greater likelihood of being readmitted</strong> into the hospital.</p>

        <h2>Discharge & Follow-Up Issues</h2>
        <iframe src="HTMLs/patient_discharge.html" width="600" height="500"></iframe>
        <p>Ignoring instances where the location of patience discharge was unknown or unclassified, the top three locations of patient discharge were <strong>home, a skilled nursing facility</strong>, or discharged/transferred to a home with <strong>home health services.</strong>
        Conducting another <strong>Chi-Squared Test of Independence</strong>, it is evident there is a very strong assocation between discharge dispostion and readmission.
       For example, patients discharged to go home or a skilled nursing facility had readmission rates of about 9.30% and 14.66%, respectively. In contrast, being discharged with "still 
       patient or expected to return for outpatient services" resulted in a whopping readmission rate of 66.67%; 2 in 3 people discharged with this status had to be readmitted to the hospital.</p>

 <!-- PIPELINE MODELLING -->
  <div class="panel" id="Pipeline Model">
    <h1>Pipeline Model</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <div class = 'highlight'>
        <h2>Baseline Model</h2>
        Initially, I used <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> to establish a baseline for comparison since it's simple, quick to train, and easily interpretable.<br>
        <pre>
                  precision    recall  f1-score   support

              0       0.92      0.69      0.79      9039
              1       0.18      0.55      0.27      1135

       accuracy                           0.67     10174
      macro avg       0.55      0.62      0.53     10174
   weighted avg       0.84      0.67      0.73     10174

        ROC AUC: 0.674763153110871
        </pre>
        The logistic regression model does well classifying data points that are <em>not</em> hospital readmissions (class 0), but does very poorly classifying those that are (class 1).
        However, in this situation, Class 1 is the significant class we want to pay attention to. The <strong>high recall (0.55)</strong> is promising because it suggests over half of the 
        positive cases are caught, although many data points are misclassified. The <strong>precision (0.18)</strong>, however, is very low, suggesting a lot of false positives.
      </div>
      <h2>Advanced Model</h2>
      For the advanced model, I used <strong>Random Forest</strong> as a stronger metric due to its ability to model nonlinear relationships. Random forest models have the power of building multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions. This method generally 
      improves predictive performance while reducing overfitting. To ensure diversity among the trees, it uses bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and random feature selection. I selected 
      Random Forest because it has the ability to <strong>handle imbalanced data</strong> and is <strong>robust to noisy features</strong>. It also has the ability to capture complex
      interactions without heavy preprocessing.<br>
      I used the following hyperparameters in my model:<br>
      <pre><code>
        rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
          n_estimators=100,
          max_depth=None,
          class_weight='balanced', 
          random_state=42
        )
      </code></pre>
      class_weight was set to 'balanced' to address the class imbalance between readmissions (which was only about 11% of the dataset) and patients who were not readmitted.
      Although the model achieved an accuracy of 0.89, which was greater than its logistic regression model's counterpart of 0.67, the Random Forest model had a <strong>recall score of only 0.01</strong>. In other words, 
      the model is only useful for catching 1% of hospital readmissions, ultimately failing its designated purpose. Its <strong>F1-Score was also 0.02</strong>, supporting the idea that the model is not useful for predicting hospital
      readmissions. Thus, the high accuracy of 89% is misleading. Instead of demonstrating the model's strong performance, it highlights the disparity between the number of 
      readmissions and non-readmissions in the hospitals. Additionally, the ROC-AUC of 0.65 suggests <strong>the model is only slightly better than random guessing</strong>,
      which would result in an ROC-AUC of 0.5.<br>
      Then, I used an <strong>XGBoost Model</strong> in hopes of achieving strong predictive accuracy while minimizing bias and variance. Once again, the validation accuracy was 0.89, but the recall was 0.00. Once again, the majority class (negatives)
      dominated, which makes the minority class underestimated more often. The model is almost never correct when identifying when a patient needs to be readmitted in under 30 days. As a result, the <strong>F1-Score was only 0.01</strong> due to poor
      positive class detection. This appears to be a central issue with this dataset; since only 11% of the data had hospital readmissions, the dataset was highly imbalanced, indicating we need to adjust hyperparameters more thoroughly and not solely 
      rely on observing accuracy.
      <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Hyperparameter Tuning</h2>
        <p>Using <strong>Randomized Search CV</strong>, I found the most optimal hyperparameters to be:</p>
        <pre><code>
          xgb_model = XGBClassifier(
            subsample= 0.7956447755377811,
            n_estimators = 527,
            min_child_weight = 2,
            max_depth = 3,
            learning_rate = 0.037281761570859454,
            colsample_bytree = 0.8093574700581173,
            scale_pos_weight = 5,
            use_label_encoder = False,
            eval_metric = 'logloss',
            random_state = 42
          )
        </code></pre>
        The goal is to <strong>minimize the number of false negatives and capture as many true positives</strong> as necessary. This means our mission is to minimize patients wrongly predicted as not being readmitted in under thirty days but who actually are. 
        To tackle this challenge, I found a threshold that would achieve this goal. Using a threshold of 0.33 to make the model more likely to predict the positive class, we obtain the following metrics:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Precision:</strong> 0.16 (validation) or 0.15 (test)</li>
          <li><strong>Recall: </strong>0.76 (validation) or 0.72 (test)</li>
          <li><strong>F1-Score: </strong>0.26 (validation) or 0.25 (test)</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy: </strong>0.53 (validation) or 0.51 (test)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Precision</strong> measures how <em>accurate</em> our predictions are, and <strong>recall</strong> measures how <em>complete</em> they are.
        For optimal performance, we would ideally like a high recall since correctly identifying readmissions is highly important. Precision, which minimizes false positives, is also important,
        but in medical scenarios like this one, minimizing false positives is less important than minimizing false negatives. Thus, instead of using the standard F-Score as my evaluation metric, 
        I will use F-beta Score and set beta = 2, placing more weight on recall. This means that recall was considered about 4 times more important than precision. 
        The <strong>F-beta Score</strong> was about <strong>0.431</strong> for the validation set and <strong>0.409</strong> for the test set. <br>
        This means:
        <ul>
          <li>Hospitals would need to intervene on about 6 patients to prevent 1 readmission.</li>
          <li>Hospitals would catch 3 out of 4 patients who would be readmitted within 30 days.</li>
        </ul>
        This trade-off is reasonable because the interventions for predicted readmissions (care coordination, follow-up calls, medication management) are <strong>relatively low-cost</strong>
        compared to the high costs of actual unplanned readmission, which could involve emergency care, extended stays, and potential complications.  
      </div>
      <h2>Class Imbalances</h2>
      Since hospital readmissions only made up 11% of the data, there was a strong imbalance of classes. I tried to handle class imbalances by employing two very powerful 
      techniques designated for class imbalances: <strong>SMOTE and ADASYN</strong>. However, neither of these improved XGBoost's F1-Score of 0.29, potentially due to poor class separability. If the minority and majority
       classes are not well-separated, synthetic examples created by SMOTE or ADASYN may fall into regions dominated by the majority class, causing more overlap between the classes
       and worse precision. Additionally, the minority class may have been too sparse, causing the synthetic data SMOTE creates to be of little use. While ADASYN focuses on 
       examples that are generally difficult to learn, it may also amplify noise by oversampling outliers or borderline points, harming the model's performance.

            The SHAP bar plot above tells us which features contributed the most to our model, on average.
            Each value on the x-axis tells us the mean magnitude, or importance, of each feature. 
            The longer the bar, the greater the impact the feature had on the model, regardless of whether it helped the model in a positive or negative manner.
            The strongest predictor of being readmitted to the hospital in under 30 days was the <strong>number of inpatient visits (staying in the hospital while under treatment) 
            the patient had in the year preceding the encounter</strong>. Conversely, a patient being discharged to another rehab facility still had some predictive value but was less influential.
            <code style="background-color: #ecf0f1; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace;">Discharge_status_Expired</code> strongly predicts a lower probability of hospital readmission, indicating the patient is deceased and therefore cannot be readmitted.

        <p>A 20-30-year-old Caucasian female had been admitted to the hospital after being referred from a clinic for an unknown cause. She stayed in the hospital for <strong>6 days</strong>, during which <strong>24 lab procedures</strong> and <strong>1 medical procedure</strong> were performed, reflecting comprehensive clinical evaluation. She was prescribed <strong>11 medications</strong>, including insulin (count 3), and had multiple chronic conditions as indicated by 9 diagnoses.

          Her maximum glucose serum was measured far above average at <strong>>300</strong>, and her dosage of insulin prescribed had decreased. 
        </p>
        <img src="PNGs/waterfall.png" alt="Case Study of Patient Predicted to Be Readmitted" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #34495e; font-size: 1rem;">
          The patient's healthcare utilization over the past year was substantial, with:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: #34495e; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 1.2rem;">
          <li><strong>9 inpatient visits</strong> made in the preceding year</li>
          <li><strong>4 emergency visits</strong> the patient made in the preceding year</li>
          <li><strong>14 total visits</strong> made to the hospital</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Despite her complex medical history, the patient was discharged to home. Our model correctly predicted to the patient would be readmitted within 30 days with a probability of <strong>88.27%</strong>.<br>
          Her profile highlights a medically complex patient with significant prior admissions to the hospital with noted changes in medication.
           Closely following up with patients, even if they are discharged to home, may reduce future readmission risk.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Business Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Develop patient education programs</strong> to educate patients at a high risk of hospital readmission so that they understand how to better take care of themselves.
          This could include modules on adhering to their medication, symptoms to watch out for, and when to seek help. Many of the patients being readmitted are relatively young (ages 20-30), so they may be able to
          lessen their chances of being readmitted if they took better care of themselves. Patients with a history of multiple hospital visits could also participate in chronic disease mangement programs
          to reduce being admitted to the emergency room.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize high-risk patients for post-discharge follow-up</strong>: Patients who have made frequent inpatient and emergency visits, like the case study patient, should be prioritized
          for following up seven days after discharge. High-risk patients that are discharged to home could have regular home health visits to ensure they are in a stable condition. </li>
          <li><strong>Continuously monitor outcomes on a dashboard</strong> that shows features such as likelihood for readmission and risk factors the patient has. Resources could be re-allocated to provide better care
          towards those at a high risk of readmission. A dashboard could also provide other data and provide other meaningful insights, such as whether a lack of access to primary care services has affected the patient's 
          risk of readmission.</li>
        </ul>
